py-skeleton-templates
=====================

Just a repository of project templates I use with py-skeleton_.

.. _py-skeleton: https://github.com/ryankanno/py-skeleton

(Ideally, you should create your own project templates.)

Stumbled upon `Cookie Cutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_ which is a fancier version of what I thought up over `here <https://github.com/ryankanno/py-skeleton>`_.
This repo will no longer be maintained as I'll be converting these templates over to `cookiecutter-py <https://github.com/ryankanno/cookiecutter-py>`_.

Here are some of the wonderful goodies you get with using my python skeleton:

- tox.ini file
- travis-ci config using tox
- coveralls integration
- requirements.txt / requirements-tox.txt / setup.py integration
- test integration with nosetests
- old-school Makefile
